This is to-do list app, built with React. With this app, you can keep track of all the tasks you need to complete. The app has several features to help you stay organized:

    1. Add a new to-do item: Simply type in your task and press the 'Add' button or hit 'Enter' on your keyboard.

    2. Remove a to-do item: Click the 'x' icon next to any completed task to remove it from the list.

    3. Empty input validation: Don't worry about submitting empty to-do items - the app won't let you do that.


We hope this app helps you stay on top of your to-do list and stay organized. Happy task-tracking!"
